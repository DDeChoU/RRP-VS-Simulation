interact with sabine:
srun  -A amcheng --pty  /bin/bash   -l 
check tasks:
squeue -A amcheng
check balance:
sbank balance statement project <projectname>


Bind-to-core:
use taskset to set hard affinity so as to bind a process to that core.
for i in range(0, n_processes):
    p = Process(target=f)
    # Pin created processes in a round-robin
    os.system("taskset -p -c %d %d" % ((i % os.cpu_count()), p.pid))
    p.start()

Some errors occur when the process is pinned to a certain node, no output is given.
